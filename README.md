# Digital Hemmer-O-Graph
## Museum: Hirshhorn
## Activity: Maker Mornings

## Project:
Create a Public Engagement activity to explain the technology used in Raphael Lozano-Hemmer's <i>Pulse</i>
Exhibition at the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC.
Activity occured every Saturday at the museum from 10am-1pm in December 2018. 
Geared toward families with young children, but open to any museum-goer.

Building on the idea of generative bio-art of Raphael Lozano-Hemmer's <i>Pulse</i> exhibit, 
I developed a few applications using similar ideas. With the finger pulse sensor used in the <i>Pulse Tank</i> 
installation, two visitors at a time take their individual beats per minute, which are then used used as 
variables, processed by a Lissajous algorithm, which produces a pattern based on the inputs. 
The application draws the pattern in realtime, currently in two formats, as lightening bugs and as dotted 
lines. In this way, visitors are able to create an abstract two-person portrait.

<i>After the drawing has built up, the result is exported and printed in two copies as a take away for 
each participant. Children like to color them in. With added Hirshhorn branding, this acts as a takeaway 
from the exhibit to be reminded of the time they spent at the museum.</i>

<i>Compiled version of heart-art to give a side-by-side comparison of the diversity of shapes when various 
pulses are combined through the algorithm.</i>
